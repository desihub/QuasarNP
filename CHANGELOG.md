## [0.1.5] - Unreleased
### Added
- [#1a063232] Added unit test to catch the bug fixed in [#a7621bb1]

### Changed
- [#a7621bb1] Fixed a bug where models with $n\neq4$ layers would use the wrong
batch normalization weights in the fully connected layer.
- [#2a6d6395] Removed all lambda functions and replaced them with partial functions or
full functions to enable pickling of QuasarNP objects. This is necessary for
multiprocessing purposes.


## [0.1.4] - 2022-07-20
### Added
- [#b5562d69] Add `read_spall` from QuasarNET.
- [#5372189d] Tests for rebinning spectra.
- [#79cc5e48] `conv1d` can now accept two different padding modes.


### Changed
- [#acd75825] Renormalizing spectra is now its own function (`utils.renormalize`)
- [#e37dcde3] Rebin now also works on eBOSS data, not just DESI data.
- [#c4dd52c6] `load_model` and `load_file` now dynamically determine the number
of convolution layers in the trained model.
- [#7e3f7141] `load_model` and `load_file` now dynamically determine the padding mode
and stride of each convolution layer
